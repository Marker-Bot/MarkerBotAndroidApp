    <string name="info"> <b>MarkerBot</b> is a project of a robot that can create drawings on a marker board based on a picture sent to it. You just need to specify the image on your computer that you want to print and the robot will use markers to draw it.

\n\n This technology will allow teachers not to be distracted by drawing plans, and office workers to draw diagrams and reports beautifully for their team.

\n\nThe robot moves along the board and draws an image with a marker embedded in it, and the camera standing in front of the board sends information about the bot\'s location to the ESP microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the signals from the transmitted situation from the camera and the requested image from the computer.

\n\nAll data transfer is implemented using the Robot Operating System and the project is easily scaled.</string>
